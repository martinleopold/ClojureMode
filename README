Clojure Mode for Processing (www.processing.org)

Uses Clojure 1.4.0 (clojure.org)

* You need Processing 2.0a5 or later, we built trunk from SVN.
* The pre-compiled bundle resides in dist. Put the the folder ClojureMode into your processing modes folder (typically a folder named "modes" inside your sketchbook folder). (Re-)start Processing and select Clojure from the modes drop-down.

* You build this yourself you need Apache Ant 
* Set properties in build.xml
    * Set the path to your processing jars (core.jar, pde.jar)
    * If you want to automatically install the mode (target: install ), set the path to your modes folder
    * If you want to run processing after building (target: run), set the path to your processing executable.

* Ant Targets:
    * build: builds the mode, creates a folder containing the mode in "dist". This can be put into the modes folder inside your sketchbook.
    * install: builds the mode and copies it to your modes folder.
    * run: builds and installs the mode, then runs processing.
